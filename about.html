            <p>Located in the northern Aegean Sea, Thassos is often called <b>“The Emerald Island”</b> due to its lush greenery
            and crystal-clear waters. Unlike many other Greek islands that are dry and rocky, Thassos is covered with 
            pine forests, olive groves, and mountainous landscapes. It's a perfect destination for those who want to 
            experience both the tranquility of nature and the charm of traditional Greek life.</p>
            <p>Although Thassos is not as globally famous as Santorini or Mykonos, it remains a favorite among local Greeks and travelers looking for a more relaxed, authentic vacation. The island is relatively small, which makes it easy to explore by car or scooter in just a few days, but it's rich in hidden spots and cultural treasures that make every moment worthwhile.</p>
            <h2 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px; color:#023047">Beaches of Thassos - From Secluded Coves to Famous Shores</h2>
            <p>Thassos boasts some of the most beautiful and diverse beaches in all of Greece. Whether you're looking for organized beaches with beach bars and sunbeds, or quiet coves where you can relax in solitude, Thassos has it all.</p>
            <p><b>Golden Beach</b> is one of the most famous beaches on the island. As its name suggests, the sand here is soft and golden, and the shallow waters make it perfect for families with children. Surrounded by green mountains, the beach offers stunning views and plenty of facilities, including restaurants and cafes right by the sea.</p>
            <p>For those seeking something more adventurous, <b>Giola Lagoon</b> is a must-visit. Often called the “natural swimming pool,” Giola is a rocky formation filled with seawater. It's a bit tricky to reach, involving a short hike, but swimming in the clear, turquoise pool while waves crash around you is an unforgettable experience.</p>
            <p>Other beaches like <b>Paradise Beach</b>, <b>Aliki</b>, and <b>Psili Ammos</b> each have their own charm—some with fine white sand, others with clear pebbles and dramatic cliffs. What they all have in common is the dazzlingly clean, blue water that Thassos is known for.</p>
